# Phase 2 Live Status

> 🧊 **FROZEN — historical record.** Phase 2 closed at tag `phase-2-codex-reviewed` (annotated, at `0d4dfc3`). Codex backfill review fix arc (T18-T22 + T24) returned GO and version was promoted from `0.1.0-phase2-draft` → `0.1.0-phase2`. Phase 3 implementation began on branch `phase-3-implementation` (T1.1 → T3a landed as of 2026-05-02).

# Phase 2 Live Status (frozen content below)

> Minimum context for compact / resume. Updated at task boundaries and before context exceeds 70%.
> **Last updated:** 2026-05-02 — **PHASE 2 TAGGED COMPLETE. Codex backfill review pending. Phase 3 planning allowed; implementation BLOCKED until backfill GO or explicit human approval.**

---

## 1. Current phase / task

- **Phase:** Phase 2 — Approval & IM Surface (✅ tagged complete; Codex backfill review pending)
- **Active task:** None. Implementation chain complete through T24 tag-gate.
- **Tag applied:** `phase-2-approval-im-surface-complete` at commit `3154f54` (annotated; deferral note in tag body). See `docs/internal/phase-2/codex-review-deferred.md`.
- **Version:** `0.1.0-phase2-draft` (will promote to `0.1.0-phase2` ONLY after deferred Codex backfill review returns GO).
- **Last completed implementation milestone:** T24 tag-gate with deferral docs (commit `3154f54`).
- **Phase 3 status:** PLANNING ALLOWED (start with `/plan-eng-review` against the candidates in `docs/internal/handoffs/2026-05-02-phase2-to-phase3.md` §"Recommended Phase 3 mission"). **IMPLEMENTATION BLOCKED** until either:
  1. Deferred Codex backfill review returns GO, OR
  2. Human explicitly authorizes Phase 3 planning-only-then-implementation work.

## 2. Branch / HEAD

- **Branch:** `phase-2-approval-im-surface`
- **Base tag:** `phase-1-runtime-complete` (`23cbca7`)

  - T21 full e2e (14 paths + index stress + bounds) `0a121e2`
  - T22 supervisor pre-attached-broker invariant `d452391`

## 3. Test count

- **Phase 2 close:** 720 passing + 1 skipped (Phase 1 baseline 320 → +400)
- **Test files:** 61
- **Suite duration:** ~2s

## 4. Codex outside-voice review status

- T7-T12: GO after fix arc (verified)
- T13-T17: GO after fix arc (verified)
- T18-T22: deferred — local Codex CLI hung in this environment. Internal gates (typecheck/lint/all tests) green. T24 will run integrated review.

## 5. Plan milestones

- 2026-05-01: plan v1 → REJECT (Codex P0×7) → v2 fix arc → APPROVE_WITH_CHANGES → v2.2 polish (`bfeb3dc`) → v2.3 round-3 polish (`7a69ad4`)
- 2026-05-01: T2-T6 landed
- 2026-05-01 → 2026-05-02: T7-T22 landed in autonomous mode after user "继续执行t7-t12，中间不需要我审批"
- 2026-05-02: T23 close-out docs (this commit)

## 6. Active redlines (carry forward to Phase 3)

See `docs/internal/handoffs/2026-05-02-phase2-to-phase3.md` §"Phase 2 redlines".

## 7. Rejected alternatives (do not relitigate)

- "First actor wins" approval semantics (Codex round-1 P0-5)
- `decision-mapper.ts` as a method-literal home (Codex round-2 C1)
- `Function.prototype.toString()` as the settleOnce-bit-identical guard (Codex round-2 T3 — uses `git show` source-range instead)
- "approve" as a Codex wire decision (Codex round-1 P1-1; v2 = "accept", legacy = "approved")
- pino as a runtime dep of `@codex-im/core` (round-3 P2-7b; duck-typed `AuditLogger`)
- T9 testing through resolve() before T10 mapper (round-3 P1-5; reordered T9 = storage only, T11 = resolve)
- ChannelAdapter open for adapter-specific extension (D14: closed; capabilities are the only escape)
- Cascading 5-consecutive-close test asserting `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` cascade (T22.4 — recast to spawn-failure halt path; the cascade counter resets on successful recovery so the 5-close path is unreachable in practice)
